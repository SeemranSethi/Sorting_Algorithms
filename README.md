# Sorting_Algortihms
Sorting is the most basic necessity of Data Structure and Algorithms.

## Most Commonly Used Sorting Algorithms
### *1.Selection Sort:*
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 
### *2.Insertion Sort:*
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
### *3.Bubble sort:*
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
### *4.Mergesort:*
The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
### *5.Quicksort:*
QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
### *6.Heapsort:*
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
### *7.Radix Sort:*
The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort. Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in the range from 1 to k.
### *8.Bucket Sort:*
Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
